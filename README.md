# Neutrino TRNG

🚀 **Neutrino TRNG** is a high-entropy, multi-source, chaos-mixed True Random Number Generator (TRNG) library written in C++.  
It is designed for ultra-secure applications requiring strong random values, such as cryptographic key generation, secure communication protocols, and advanced authentication systems.

## 🌌 Key Features

- **Multi-source entropy**: Combines system noise, CPU load, and system timestamp.
- **Chaotic mixing**: Applies a Logistic Map chaotic function to increase unpredictability.
- **Multi-layer hashing**: SHA-3 and Keccak cryptographic hashing layers.
- **OpenSSL integrated**: Secure, industrial-grade cryptographic backend.
- **Lightweight and fast**: Designed for real-time applications.
- **Cross-platform**: Primarily for Linux, easy to port to other systems.
- **Simple API**: Single function call to generate high-entropy 512-bit hash.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Install from `.deb` Package

Download the latest `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/PolarV-UNIX/neutrino_trng/releases) and install:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i neutrino-trng-1.0.deb
sudo ldconfig
```

---

### 2. Build from Source

#### Requirements:
- C++17 compiler (`g++ 9+`)
- `libssl-dev` (OpenSSL development libraries)
- `cmake` (optional but recommended)

#### Build manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PolarV-UNIX/neutrino_trng.git
cd neutrino-trng
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig
```

---

## 💻 Usage

### Include in your C++ project:

```cpp
#include <neutrino_trng/neutrino_trng.h>
```

### Generate a secure random 512-bit hash:

```cpp
const char* hash = generate_neutrino_hash();
std::cout << "Generated Hash: " << hash << std::endl;
```

### Compile:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -lneutrino_trng -lssl -lcrypto
```

## 🎯 API Reference

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `const char* generate_neutrino_hash()` | Generates a 512-bit chaotic, high-entropy, cryptographically secure random hash. |

---

## 🛡️ Security Notice

- Neutrino TRNG is intended for cryptographic purposes.  
- Sources of entropy are mixed with chaotic behavior before hashing.
- Cryptographic layers use OpenSSL standards.

✅ Always make sure you compile and link against trusted OpenSSL libraries.

---

## 🌍 Future Plans

- Add hardware-based entropy sources (e.g., microphone noise, ADC noise).
- Build Rust and Python bindings.
- Extend support for Windows and macOS.
- Add FIPS-compliant hash functions.
